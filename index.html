## What is AppTimeOut?

**AppTimeOut** is a wellness and productivity app that helps users reduce digital distractions by locking selected apps and adding accountability from a trusted partner.

Instead of relying on willpower alone, AppTimeOut lets you **commit to a lock** and optionally require a **partner-generated unlock code** before you can get back in.

## Key features (planned for v1)

- **Quick Lock timer**  
  Choose a lock duration (for example 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 3 hours) and instantly block your most distracting apps.

- **Scheduled locks**  
  Set recurring lock schedules (like weekday evenings) so your phone is quieter when you want to focus or relax.

- **Partner-based unlock**  
  Share an unlock code with a trusted partner so you can’t unlock early without talking to them first.

- **Self-unlock option**  
  Prefer to manage things on your own? You can keep the lock self-controlled while still using timers and schedules.

## Purpose

This app uses Apple’s **FamilyControls** and **ScreenTime** APIs solely to support intentional phone use and time-management.  
AppTimeOut is designed for:

- Students who want fewer distractions while studying  
- Parents who want help staying off social media  
- Anyone who wants a simple way to reduce screen time and improve focus

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is a core design principle.

- **No screenshots or screen recordings** are collected  
- **No device usage logs** are uploaded to a server  
- **No sensitive personal information** (such as contacts, messages, or browsing history) is collected  
- All data stays on the user’s device unless the user explicitly chooses to share an unlock code with a partner

If this privacy policy changes in the future, the app and this page will be updated before new data is collected.
