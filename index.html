## Purpose

AppTimeOut is a wellness and productivity app that helps users reduce digital distractions by locking selected apps and requiring accountability from a trusted partner.

This app uses Apple's FamilyControls and ScreenTime APIs solely to support intentional phone use and time management.

---

## Privacy

AppTimeOut does not collect screenshots, device usage logs, screen recordings, or sensitive personal information.  
All data stays on the user’s device unless the user explicitly chooses to share an unlock code.
